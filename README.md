### Spec
#### Programs
1. So far a program only consists of 1 file, but that will change in the future, and so will likely below points.
2. A program is just one single anonymous function (counting `<input args>` to it).
3. The compiler will evaluate this function as much as it can during compilation, and then convert the remnants into the specified output format.
	- Normally this is machine code

#### Anonymous functions
1. Structure: `(<input pars> => <function body>) <input args>`.
2. `<input pars>` = `(<par1>) [(<par2>) ...]`
3. `<input args>` = `<arg1> [<arg2> ...]`
4. Every parameter is a *pattern def*.
5. All functions are closures.
6. If not enough input args are given, the function is partially applied.
7. Once fully applied, functions reduce to `<function body>` (with all `<input pars>` defined).
	- This is what it means to say that a function returns `<function body>`
8. Functions and patterns can be (partially) called/applied inside of `<function body>`, `<input args>` and `<pattern to define>`.
	- Note that surrounding parentheses are *always* necessary when applying inside `<pattern to define>`

#### Patterns (variables but better)
1. `<pattern def>` = `($(<pattern to define>) as <pattern to match>)` where
	- `<pattern to define>` = ` <dname start>  [(<pattern def>)|<dname continuation> ...] [<dname end>]` where
		- `<dname start>`, `dname continuation`, `<dname end>` are allowed to contain any symbols, including whitespace (TODO: exception for ops)
	- `<pattern to match>`  = `[<mname start>] [(<pattern def>)|<mname continuation>|$(<var>|#<n>) ...] [<mname end>]` where
		- `<mname start>`, `mname continuation`, `<mname end>` are allowed to contain any symbols, including whitespace (TODO: exception for ops)
		- `$<var>` is either:
			- a name for a parameter that is linked to a parameter of the same name in `<pattern to define>`, or
			- the symbol `_` (specifying to link whatever parameter is left to link)
		- `<n>` is a number specifying what parameter to link to
		- ex: `(($(add (1) and (2) to ($(a) as 3) plus $b) as $#1 $a $#0 $_) => ...) ($x $y $z $w => x + y + z + w)` where
			- `...` = `add 1 and 2 to 3 plus 4` => `($x $y $z $w => x + y + z + w) 2 3 1 4` => `2 + 3 + 1 + 4`
	- patterns named `_` (written like `($_ as ...)`) are called unnamed patterns and will not be defined

2. Call structure for ex. def. `$(example pattern taking (_ as _) and (_ as _)) as _`:
	- mixfix ex: `example pattern taking (x) and (123)`
	- prefix ex: `(example pattern taking $_ and $_) x 123`
		- `$_` is here used as an unnamed pattern since `_`

3. Patterns are defined within the scope described by the *pattern parsing algorithm*.

4. Patterns can only be defined within `<input pars>`.
	- If it looks like a pattern is defined outside, it's actually a partially applied pattern

5. Patterns, like functions, can be partially applied.
	- This can be done by leaving out some of the `<input args>` or by having placeholders for args using `$(<placeholder pattern>)`
		- `<placeholder pattern>` has the same syntax as `<pattern to define>`, but doesn't define the pattern
		- Given a defined pattern `$($a f $b $c)`:
			- ex. of leaving out args: `f`, `1 f`, `f 2`, `1 f 2`
			- ex. of having placeholders: `$x f $y $z`, `1 f $y $z`, `$x f 2 $z`, `$x f $y 3`, `1 f $y 3`
			- ex. of both: `1 f $y 3`

6. Patterns only consisting of names are called *variables*.

#### Pattern parsing algorithm
1. Choose a `$(...)` and move to its outside.
	- NOTE: If the pattern is after 'as', choose a '#(...)' here instead (? TODO)
2. If inside another `$(...)`, move to its outside, and then keep leaving scopes until you find `as`.
   If not, keep leaving scopes until you find `=>`.
3. Your pattern is defined after this `as` or `=>`.

#### Pattern matching
1. When a pattern name is used, the compiler will try to find a matching pattern definition. If it can't find any match, it reports a compile error.

2. If 2 or more variables in the same function have the same name they will be pattern matched to be equal.
	- i.e. in `$x $y $x => ...` the 2 `x`s must be equal
	- the equality function `==` is defined using this

3. An or-pattern, `` a`|`b`|`...`|`z ``, can be used in pattern matching.
	- ``a`|`b`|`c`` <=> ``a`|`a`|`b`|`c`|`b`|`a`` <=> ``c`|`a`|`b``
	- `a`, `b`, `c`, ``a`|`b``, ``a`|`c`` and ``a`|`b`|`c`` all match ``a`|`b`|`c``
	- ``a`|`b`|`c``, ``a`|`b`` and ``a`|`c`` *may* match `a`, `b` or `c` (and ``a`|`b`|`c`` *may* match ``a`|`b``)
		- by default this will compile and instead pattern matching will be completed at runtime; if this fails, the program crashes
		- if using `prerun` this counts as failing to match and won't compile

4. `` `...` `` are used in (or-)patterns to let the compiler figure out the rest.
	- ex: ``` 0`|`1`|``...` ``` is an or-pattern consisting of all integers >= 0

5. Pattern matching is done at compile time whenever possible. If pattern matching can't be completed during compile time, it will continue during runtime.
	- `prerun` can be used to override this and force pattern matching to be completed during compile time
	-    `run` can be used to override this and force pattern matching to only be done during runtime

6. The special `Undefined` value matches any pattern.
	- i.e. `$x as 123` <=> `$x as Undefined|123`
		- note that while this will compile, if `x` is `Undefined` but still used during runtime the program will crash
	- `$x as Undefined` specifies that `x` must be `Undefined`
		- useful for expressions returning an infinite loop: `forever {...}: Undefined`

#### Values
1. Partially applied functions and patterns are treated as values.
2. There exists a special `Undefined` value, which will be inserted into compilation or-patterns whenever a value might not come to exist during runtime. This happens if:
	- the program specifies it might crash during runtime
		- ex: `let x = rand any Int; if x == 1337 {panic!}; x` returns `Undefined|(any Int)` during compilation
	- the compiler suspects there is an infinite loop in the program
		- ex: `let x: auto = 0; forever {x++}; x` returns `Undefined|1|2|...` during compilation
		- note that due to the halting problem the compiler may think there is an infinite loop when there isn't, hence 'suspects'
	- for more info, see "Example code snippets" §1
3. There are no other values.
	- Numbers, strings, etc. are defined as partially applied functions or patterns
4. Values are differentiated using pattern matching (as described under "Patterns" and "Pattern matching").

#### Pseudo-values
1. Pseudo-values are similar to values but act a bit differently, and include:
	- or-patterns
		- ex: `1|2|3`
	- placeholder-values
		- ex: `$x` (outside of pattern definition)
2. Pseudo-values may be created by the programmer and/or the compiler.
	- programmer ex:
		- or-patterns: `random value in range 0|1|...`
		- placeholder-values: `$n+1`
	- compiler ex:
		- or-patterns: creates an or-pattern for what `(123|456|789) + 1` returns: `124|457|790`
		- placeholder-values: inserts missing placeholder in `+1` by converting to `$n+1`
3. Pseudo-values can be placed anywhere values can (if in the right situation).
4. Pseudo-values only exist before runtime (during compilation).
	- or-patterns (eventually) collapse into single values at runtime
		- i.e. `1|2` collapses into either `1` or `2`
		- programs not allowing this to happen won't be accepted by the compiler (TODO: check if this works, maybe change to runtime crash?)
	- placeholder-values are converted into something else at runtime (TODO: figure out what)
5. Or-patterns are further described in "Pattern matching" §3
6. Placeholder-values are further described in "Patterns" §5

#### Equality
1. 2 (finally evaluated) values are equal iff all below criteria are met:
	- They have the same amount of parameters   in the same order
	- They have the same applied args           in the same order
	- They have the same `<pattern to match>`:s in the same order
	- They have the same name (or both have no name at all)
2. 2 placeholder-values are always equal.
	- i.e. `$xyz == $abc`
3. Equality of or-patterns is either decided after collapse at runtime, *or* during compilation iff all below criteria are met:
	- They consist of the same values in the same order
	- They were both formed as a result of known-to-be-equal pseudo-values being combined in some way with *known* terms (see "Misc" §11)
4. 2 values being equal and 2 values matching are related but not the same, see "Pattern matching" §2
5. See "Example code snippets" §1 for an example of equality.

#### Syntax sugar
1. `$(<pattern to define>)` <=> `($(<pattern to define>) as _)` <=> `($(<pattern to define>) as $#0 [$#1 ...])`
	- If the pattern is a variable, this allows the input to be any kind of function, which you can call like `<defined pattern> [<arg1>] [<arg2> ...]`
	- If the pattern isn't a variable, the amount of `$` after `as` will match the amount of parameters of the pattern
		- i.e. `$(pattern taking $x and $y)` <=> `($(pattern taking $x and $y) as $#0 $#1)`

2. `(<pattern to match>)`   <=> `($_ as <pattern to match>)`    <=> `(_ as <pattern to match>)`
	- Note that `$_` and `_` are not generally equivalent; this is a special case

3. `$(<variable to define>) as <pattern to match>` <=> `$(<variable to define> _ [_ ...]) as <pattern to match>`
	- i.e. `$b as Bool _` <=> `$(b _) as Bool _`

4. `scope` can be used to avoid making your program look like Lisp:
	- `(<input pars> => scope) <input args> <rest of scope>` <=> `(<input pars> $scope => scope) <input args> (<rest of scope>)`

5. `$(<pattern to define>) as frozen <pattern to match>` can be used to delay evaluation of input until inside the scope where the pattern is defined:
	- `(($x as frozen _) => x) <expr>`   <=> `(($x as _) => x _) {<expr>}`
	- `$(<pattern to define>) as frozen` <=> `$(<pattern to define>) as frozen _`

#### Built-in "functions"
1. `ALL_ARGS <function>` returns all possible args that can be applied to the function. `length >= 1`.
2. `APPLIED_ARGS <function>` returns the args that have been applied to the function. `length >= 0`.
3. `ATTRIBUTE <attr> <id>` tells the compiler that `<id>` has attribute `<attr>` and returns `<id>`.
	- Precedence is specified using attributes
4. `frozen <expr>` delays evaluation of `<expr>` until it has left the current scope.
5. `stringify <code>` converts `<code>` to a string
6. `codify <string>` converts `<string>` to code
7. `codify (stringify <code>)` <=> `<code>`
8. `continue from <function> or alt <expr>` continues pattern matching if possible, else evaluates `<expr>`.
	- if `<function>` is `caller` it will continue from the caller

#### Misc
1. `_` is a special built-in symbol meaning different things in different contexts, but typically it means "anything".
2. `(<expr>)` *always* has higher precedence than `<expr>`.
3. Number literals, char literals and string literals are built-in and bound to library implementations similarly to Agda.
4. Precedence can be overriden using `#precedence (below|above) <function> <your function>`.
5. P+ uses eager evaluation.
6. `(<expr>)` returns whatever is left of `<expr>` after evaluation to the outer scope.
7. The compiler will try to run as much as possible during compilation unless otherwise specified.
8. Single-line `//` and multi-line `/* */` comments are built-in (to avoid issues with nested strings).
9. `Maximal munch`/`Longest match` parsing is used to solve ambiguity (unless invalid; then context is used).
10. In case there's ambiguity between if a fully applied function or another partially applied function was intended, the compiler will assume the fully applied function was intended and give a warning about this.
    - I.e. `if True do_something` is assumed to mean the fully applied `if $cond $body` function rather than a partially applied `if $cond $expr else $expr`.
11. An expression, or term, is said to be *known* to the compiler if the compiler sees it as a specific value rather than a pseudo-value.

#### Example code snippets
1.
```Swift
let n  = rand any Nat;
let n2 = rand any Nat;

// - n == n is True
// - The remaining terms of LHS & RHS are known
// => Compiler can determine if True or False
(n - 1)            * 2 + 2 == n * 2
Undefined|0|1|...  * 2 + 2 == 0|2|4...
// Potential Undefined(s) found!
// Add Undefined to or-pattern, then
// start over with values not leading to Undefined:
          0|1|...  * 2 + 2 ==   2|4|...
          0|2|...      + 2 ==   2|4|...
          2|4|...          ==   2|4|...
// LHS == RHS since:
// - Compiler can determine if True or False
// - LHS & RHS or-patterns consist of the same values in the same order
=> Undefined|True

// - n == n2 is True|False
// => Compiler *cannot* determine if True or False
(n - 1)            * 2 + 2 == n2 * 2
Undefined|0|1|...  * 2 + 2 == 0|2|4...
// Potential Undefined(s) found!
// Since the compiler cannot determine anything more,
// and it's irrelevant if there are more potential Undefineds,
// it stops here and returns:
=> Undefined|True|False
```

### [OLD] Syntax
1. Functions are defined using `<input> => <output>`.

2. `(<expr>)` *always* has higher precedence than `<expr>`.

3. Functions can have 1 or more args.
    - (define `f _ => ...` and call with `f _` to emulate 0 args)

4. Functions can have almost any structure (mixfix with additions).

5. Function names can only contain *either* characters *or* operators.

6. Variable function input is denoted by `$<var>`.

7. Non-variable (specific functions) input (except literals) or input with both non-variables and variables require surrounding `()`.

8. Number literals, char literals and string literals are built-in and bound to library implementations similarly to Agda.

9. Precedence can be overriden using `#precedence (below|above) <function> <your function>`.

10. `(<expr>)` returns whatever is left of `<expr>` after evaluation to the outer scope.

11. Functions return themselves and can be called "anonymously".

12. Functions return *partially* if passed as args to a non-evaluating function.
    - I.e. `f (g $x => x)` partially returns `(g $x => x)`.
    - **NOTE:** This does *not* apply to anonymous functions. I.e. `f ($x => x)` does *not* partially return `($x => x)`.

13. Functions are *only* defined in the scope they were created and scopes in which they (possibly partially) have been returned to.
    - **NOTE:** Functions are *not* defined inside functions they are passed to (except inside the variable). This means that `let f = g;` is different from `g;` in that the latter returns and therefore defines the function `g` in the scope while the former does not.

14. `_` is a special built-in symbol meaning different things in different contexts, but typically it means "anything".

15. Function input works using pattern matching of function names and their args.

16. `continue from <function> or alt <expr>` continues pattern matching if possible, else evaluates `<expr>`.

17. `caller` is a reserved keyword for the caller of the current function.

18. Functions which are passed fewer args than required are called *partially applied* and return the partially applied versions of themselves.

19. `` a`|`b`|`...`|`z `` is an or-pattern.

20. `` `...` `` are used in (or-)patterns to let the compiler figure out the rest.

21. The compiler will try to run as much as possible during compilation unless otherwise specified.

22. `prerun <expr>` ensures `<expr>` runs during compilation.

23. `run <expr>` ensures `<expr>` runs during runtime.

24. `stringify <expr>` turns the code of `<expr>` into a string.

25. `op <operator>[\n op <operator>...]` defines operators, which are defined to be characters placeable right next to separate functions.
    - I.e. `op ;` allows `($expr; =>);`.

26. Single-line `//` and multi-line `/* */` comments are built-in (to avoid issues with nested strings).

27. Passing all required args to a function will run it.

28. `ALL_ARGS <function>` returns all possible args that can be applied to the function. `length >= 1`.

29. `APPLIED_ARGS <function>` returns the args that have been applied to the function. `length >= 0`.

30. `Maximal munch`/`Longest match` parsing is used to solve ambiguity (unless invalid; then context is used).

31. In case there's ambiguity between if a fully applied function or another partially applied function was intended, the compiler will assume the fully applied function was intended and give a warning about this.
    - I.e. `if True do_something` is assumed to mean the fully applied `if $cond $body` function rather than a partially applied `if $cond $expr else $expr`.
