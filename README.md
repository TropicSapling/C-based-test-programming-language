... and most importantly:
* **It makes sense.**

## Features
#### Definitions
<sup>Keywords surrounded by</sup>
* <sub>brackets (`[]`) are *optional*</sub>
* <sub>angle brackets (`<>`) **must** be replaced by a name of your choice</sub>
* <sub>backticks (`` ` ``) are **required** and escapes these definitions (i.e. `` `<type>` `` means you must literally type `<type>`)</sub>
* <sub>parentheses (`()`) **and** seperated by bars (`|`) are part of a list of mutually exclusive **required** keywords</sub>

### Spec
#### Anonymous functions
1. Structure: `(<input pars> => <function body>) <input args>`.
2. `<input pars>` = `(<par1>) [(<par2>) ...]`
3. `<input args>` = `<arg1> [<arg2> ...]`
4. Every parameter is a *pattern def*.
5. If not enough input args are given, the function is partially applied.

#### Patterns (variables but better)
1. `<pattern def>` = `($(<pattern to define>) as <pattern to match>)` where
	- `<pattern to define>` = ` <dname start>  [(<pattern def>)|<dname continuation> ...] [<dname end>]` where
		- `<dname start>`, `dname continuation`, `<dname end>` are allowed to contain any symbols, including whitespace (TODO: exception for ops)
	- `<pattern to match>`  = `[<mname start>] [(<pattern def>)|<mname continuation>|#<n> ...] [<mname end>]` where
		- `<mname start>`, `mname continuation`, `<mname end>` are allowed to contain any symbols, including whitespace (TODO: exception for ops)
		- `<n>` is either:
			- a name for a parameter that is linked to a parameter of the same name in `<pattern to define>`, or
			- a number specifying what parameter to link to
			- ex: `(($(add (4) and (2) to ($(a) as 7)) as #1 #a #0) => ...) ($x $y $z => x + y * z)` where
				- `...` = `add 4 and 2 to 7` => `($x $y $z => x + y * z) 2 7 4` => `2 + 7 * 4` => `2 + 28` => `30`
2. Call structure for ex. def. `$(example pattern taking (_ as _) and (_ as _)) as _`:
	- mixfix ex: `example pattern taking (x) and (123)`
	- prefix ex: `(example pattern taking $_ and $_) x 123`
3. Patterns are defined within the scope described by the *pattern parsing algorithm*.
4. Patterns can only be defined within `<input pars>`.
	- if it looks like a pattern is defined outside, it's actually part of a call to a defined pattern
5. Patterns, like functions, can be partially applied.

#### Pattern parsing algorithm
1. Choose a `$(...)` and move to its outside.
2. If inside another `$(...)`, move to its outside, and then keep leaving scopes until you find `as`.
   If not, keep leaving scopes until you find `=>`.
3. Your pattern is defined after this `as` or `=>`.

#### Pattern matching
1. When a pattern name is used, the compiler will try to find a matching pattern definition. If it can't find any match, it reports a compile error.
2. If 2 or more variables in the same function have the same name they will be pattern matched to be equal.
	- i.e. in `$x $y $x => ...` the 2 `x`s must be equal
3. An or-pattern, `` a`|`b`|`...`|`z ``, can be used in pattern matching.
	- `a|b|c` <=> `a|a|b|c|b|a` <=> `c|a|b`
	- `a`, `b`, `c`, `a|b`, `a|c` and `a|b|c` all match `a|b|c`
	- `a|b|c`, `a|b` and `a|c` *may* match `a`, `b` or `c` (and `a|b|c` *may* match `a|b`)
		- by default this will compile and instead pattern matching will be completed at runtime; if this fails, the program crashes
		- if using `prerun` this counts as failing to match and won't compile
	- `a|b|c == a|b`, `a|b|c == a|c` and `a|b|c == a|b|c` all return `True|False`
4. `` `...` `` are used in (or-)patterns to let the compiler figure out the rest.
	- ex: `0|1|...` is an or-pattern consisting of all integers >= 0 
5. Pattern matching is done at compile time whenever possible. If pattern matching can't be completed during compile time, it will continue during runtime.
	- `prerun` can be used to override this and force pattern matching to be completed during compile time
	-    `run` can be used to override this and force pattern matching to only be done during runtime

#### Syntax sugar
1. `$(<pattern to define>)` <=> `($(<pattern to define>) as _)` <=> `($(<pattern to define>) as #0 [#1 ...])`
	- Note that this allows the input to be any kind of function, which you can call like `<defined pattern> [<arg1>] [<arg2> ...]`
2. `(<pattern to match>)`   <=> `(_ as <pattern to match>)`
3. `scope` can be used to avoid making your program look like Lisp:
	- `(<input pars> => scope) <input args> <rest of scope>` <=> `(<input pars> $scope => scope) <input args> (<rest of scope>)`
4. `$(<pattern to define>) as frozen <pattern to match>` can be used to delay evaluation of input until inside the scope where the pattern is defined:
	- `(($x as frozen _) => x) <expr>`   <=> `(($x as _) => x _) {<expr>}`
	- `$(<pattern to define>) as frozen` <=> `$(<pattern to define>) as frozen _`

#### Built-in "functions"
1. `ALL_ARGS <function>` returns all possible args that can be applied to the function. `length >= 1`.
2. `APPLIED_ARGS <function>` returns the args that have been applied to the function. `length >= 0`.
3. `frozen <expr>` delays evaluation of `<expr>` until it has left the current scope.

#### Misc
1. `_` is a special built-in symbol meaning different things in different contexts, but typically it means "anything".
2. `(<expr>)` *always* has higher precedence than `<expr>`.
3. Number literals, char literals and string literals are built-in and bound to library implementations similarly to Agda.
4. Precedence can be overriden using `#precedence (below|above) <function> <your function>`.
5. P+ uses eager evaluation.
6. `(<expr>)` returns whatever is left of `<expr>` after evaluation to the outer scope.
7. The compiler will try to run as much as possible during compilation unless otherwise specified.
8. `stringify <expr>` turns the code of `<expr>` into a string.
9. Single-line `//` and multi-line `/* */` comments are built-in (to avoid issues with nested strings).
10. `Maximal munch`/`Longest match` parsing is used to solve ambiguity (unless invalid; then context is used).
11. In case there's ambiguity between if a fully applied function or another partially applied function was intended, the compiler will assume the fully applied function was intended and give a warning about this.
    - I.e. `if True do_something` is assumed to mean the fully applied `if $cond $body` function rather than a partially applied `if $cond $expr else $expr`.

### [OLD] Syntax
1. Functions are defined using `<input> => <output>`.

2. `(<expr>)` *always* has higher precedence than `<expr>`.

3. Functions can have 1 or more args.
    - (define `f _ => ...` and call with `f _` to emulate 0 args)

4. Functions can have almost any structure (mixfix with additions).

5. Function names can only contain *either* characters *or* operators.

6. Variable function input is denoted by `$<var>`.

7. Non-variable (specific functions) input (except literals) or input with both non-variables and variables require surrounding `()`.

8. Number literals, char literals and string literals are built-in and bound to library implementations similarly to Agda.

9. Precedence can be overriden using `#precedence (below|above) <function> <your function>`.

10. `(<expr>)` returns whatever is left of `<expr>` after evaluation to the outer scope.

11. Functions return themselves and can be called "anonymously".

12. Functions return *partially* if passed as args to a non-evaluating function.
    - I.e. `f (g $x => x)` partially returns `(g $x => x)`.
    - **NOTE:** This does *not* apply to anonymous functions. I.e. `f ($x => x)` does *not* partially return `($x => x)`.

13. Functions are *only* defined in the scope they were created and scopes in which they (possibly partially) have been returned to.
    - **NOTE:** Functions are *not* defined inside functions they are passed to (except inside the variable). This means that `let f = g;` is different from `g;` in that the latter returns and therefore defines the function `g` in the scope while the former does not.

14. `_` is a special built-in symbol meaning different things in different contexts, but typically it means "anything".

15. Function input works using pattern matching of function names and their args.

16. `continue from <function> or alt <expr>` continues pattern matching if possible, else evaluates `<expr>`.

17. `caller` is a reserved keyword for the caller of the current function.

18. Functions which are passed fewer args than required are called *partially applied* and return the partially applied versions of themselves.

19. `` a`|`b`|`...`|`z `` is an or-pattern.

20. `` `...` `` are used in (or-)patterns to let the compiler figure out the rest.

21. The compiler will try to run as much as possible during compilation unless otherwise specified.

22. `prerun <expr>` ensures `<expr>` runs during compilation.

23. `run <expr>` ensures `<expr>` runs during runtime.

24. `stringify <expr>` turns the code of `<expr>` into a string.

25. `op <operator>[\n op <operator>...]` defines operators, which are defined to be characters placeable right next to separate functions.
    - I.e. `op ;` allows `($expr; =>);`.

26. Single-line `//` and multi-line `/* */` comments are built-in (to avoid issues with nested strings).

27. Passing all required args to a function will run it.

28. `ALL_ARGS <function>` returns all possible args that can be applied to the function. `length >= 1`.

29. `APPLIED_ARGS <function>` returns the args that have been applied to the function. `length >= 0`.

30. `Maximal munch`/`Longest match` parsing is used to solve ambiguity (unless invalid; then context is used).

31. In case there's ambiguity between if a fully applied function or another partially applied function was intended, the compiler will assume the fully applied function was intended and give a warning about this.
    - I.e. `if True do_something` is assumed to mean the fully applied `if $cond $body` function rather than a partially applied `if $cond $expr else $expr`.
