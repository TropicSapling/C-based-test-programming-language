# Things that need more thinking
## frozen
- Lazy?

## impl box

## purity
- Proving equality?

## == box
- How will this "non-strict" equality work?

## concurrency

## functions
- getting function without calling it?
- anonymous functions?
- could spaces in names be problematic?

## memory
- rust borrow system? changes?
- memory layouts (of boxes)?

## mutability
- Dependent types makes mutability harder
- Maybe immutability by default, then specify what ranges of mutability are allowed?
